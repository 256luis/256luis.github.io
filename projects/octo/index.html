<h2><a href=https://github.com/256luis/octo>Octo</a></h2>
<p>Octo is a modern, statically and strongly-typed programming language that
transpiles to C code. It offers a clean syntax reminiscent of other
high-level languages, supporting features like basic type inference,
arrays, pointers, and user-defined structs and unions. The language is
strict with types, disallowing implicit casts between signed and unsigned
integers or between numeric and floating-point types, and only allowing
implicit casting from smaller to larger numeric types. Octo also provides
familiar control flow structures like if-statements, while-loops, and
Python-like for-loops for iterating over arrays.</p>

func fib(n: i64) -&gt; i64
{
    if n == 0 return 0;
    if n == 1 return 1;

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

func main() -&gt; i32
{
    let n = 5;
    let nth_fib = fib(n);
    printf(&quot;fib(%d) = %d&quot;, n, nth_fib);
}
