<p>Easy2D is a super simple, easy to use, software-rendered, graphics
library. Other than drawing pixels to the screen, it also handles
windowing, image loading, and mouse/keyboard input. I wrote everything
from scratch, without any libraries other than the C standard library and
the Win32 API (and stb_image).</p>
